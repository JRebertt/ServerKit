"""One place that turns an *unexpected* exception into a recorded, correlated 500.

The global ``@app.errorhandler(500)`` logs the crash, records it into the
centralized error log behind ``/monitoring/errors``, and answers with the
documented JSON body carrying a request id. A route that catches ``Exception``
itself never reaches that handler, so its crash is logged nowhere and is
invisible on the errors page — the failure looks handled precisely because
someone handled it.

That is why this module exists rather than only the handler: the recording side
is importable, so a route that must keep answering JSON in-band can still put
its crash on the record.

Use it only for genuinely unexpected failures. An expected, caller-actionable
failure should raise one of ``app.exceptions``' typed errors instead — those
are not crashes and must not fill the error log.

        return jsonify(SomeService.run())
    except Exception as exc:            # noqa: BLE001
        return unexpected_response(exc)

Prefer deleting the ``try``/``except`` entirely where nothing in it does real
cleanup: letting the exception reach the global handler produces the same
response through the same recorder, with one less thing to keep in step.
