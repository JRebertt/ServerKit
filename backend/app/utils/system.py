       *user* is only correct for privilege ESCALATION, not for identity

       process is already root — the whole ``sudo -n -u <user>`` prefix is
       dropped and the command runs as the current user, not as *user*.

       That is right for "give me root, I am not root"; it is wrong for
       "run this as postgres". ``database_service`` needs the second, because
       PostgreSQL's local peer auth maps the OS user to the DB role, so a root
       panel silently connecting as role ``root`` fails authentication. Its
       five ``psql``/``pg_dump`` sites therefore spell ``sudo -u postgres``
       out themselves and go through :func:`run_checked` unprivileged.

       *user* currently has no callers. Before giving it one, decide what
       should happen as root — ``runuser``/``su`` rather than dropping the
       switch — and test it on a root install.

    ``sudo -n`` (non-interactive) is always used: nothing here runs attached to a
    human terminal, and callers capture output, so a password prompt would be
    invisible AND unanswerable — sudo would simply block forever, hanging the
    caller (this hung backend startup on a non-root host, via the metadata
    guard's iptables probe). Failing immediately with a non-zero exit is the

    ``{'success': False, 'error': ...}`` constructions. Each of those is a

    into a false fact about the operator's server.

    ``returncode`` is ``None`` when the command never ran, which is the
    distinction the hand-rolled handlers keep losing: exit code 1 means the
    command answered "no", while no exit code at all means nobody answered.
    A caller that renders "not installed" must check ``returncode is not None``
    first, and now it can.

    ``stderr`` is the raw stream; ``error`` is the verdict — a human-facing
    message, ``None`` on success. They are separate because plenty of commands
    write to stderr and still succeed (``docker exec``, ``git``), so folding
    the stream into the verdict would invent failures. Callers that show
    command output want ``stderr``; callers that report a problem want
    ``error``.

    ``merge_stderr=True`` interleaves stderr into ``output`` the way a terminal
    would (``stderr=STDOUT``). ``docker logs`` needs it — a container's stderr
    is part of its log, not an error about fetching the log — and hand-rolled
    ``result.stdout + result.stderr`` concatenation is not the same thing: it
    loses the ordering.

    ``privileged=True`` routes through :func:`run_privileged` — same sudo-vs-root
    decision, same argv[0] resolution, so no caller re-implements either.

    ``timeout`` defaults to 60s rather than ``None`` on purpose: with output
