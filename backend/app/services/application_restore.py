"""Recycle-bin hooks for Application: what a delete stops, and what a purge destroys.

The split this module exists to enforce:

    SOFT DELETE   stop serving. Containers down (volumes KEPT), vhost removed,
                  firewall ports closed, cron suspended. Every one of those is
                  reversible.
    RESTORE       re-publish. Vhost rewritten from the app's live domains,
                  firewall reopened, cron resumed. Containers are left STOPPED.
    PURGE         the irreversible half: data volumes removed, uploaded source
                  tree deleted, cron association dropped, row destroyed.

Why the split matters: `delete_app` used to run `compose_down(volumes=True)` and
`shutil.rmtree()` on the way out. Doing that AND keeping a tombstone would offer
a Restore button for a row whose data the delete had already destroyed — the one
promise the recycle bin cannot break. So the destructive half moved to purge and
the tombstone now means something.

Containers are deliberately NOT restarted on restore, for the reason
`domain_restore` does not re-issue certificates: "put it back" should not
silently start processes, open ports to the internet, or begin consuming CPU on
a machine whose owner has not looked at this app in three weeks. The row is
back, it is published, and Start is one click away.
