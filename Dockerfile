# ============================================
# ServerKit Dockerfile - Single Container
# ============================================
# This Dockerfile creates a single container with both
# frontend and backend. Good for simple deployments.
#
# For production with separate containers and nginx,
# use docker-compose.yml instead.
#
# Build: docker build -t serverkit .
# Run:   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env serverkit
#        Override the internal backend port with SERVERKIT_BACKEND_PORT if needed.
#
# Build args:
#   INSTALL_CLAMAV=true   bundle the ClamAV scanner (~250 MB). Off by default:
#                         malware scanning falls back to the builtin YARA/pure-
#                         Python matcher and reports clamav_available=false, so
#                         the feature degrades instead of breaking. Operators who
#                         want ClamAV can build with it or apt-install it beside
#                         the panel.
# ============================================

# Stage 1: Build Frontend
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM: dist/ is static JS/CSS (arch-independent), so this
# stage always runs natively on the build machine — never under QEMU, where an
# emulated `npm ci` takes 20-40 min (or hangs) during multi-arch release builds.

# ============================================
# Stage 2: Python dependency builder
#
# The compiler toolchain (gcc, *-dev headers) is needed to build wheels for
# gevent / cryptography / lxml on platforms without a prebuilt wheel, but it is
# ~280 MB and has no business in a running panel. Building into a self-contained
# venv here lets the runtime stage take the result and leave the toolchain behind.

#
# 1. Bundled test suites. Third-party packages ship their own pytest trees
#    (gevent and passlib are the big ones) that no running panel imports.
# 2. botocore API models. botocore carries JSON models for 400+ AWS services
#    (~15 MB); ServerKit constructs exactly three clients — s3
#    (storage_provider_service), route53 (dns_provider_service) and ses
